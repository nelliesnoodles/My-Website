# my-first-blog
# now my first website with apps
followed tutorial from Django Girls @ https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/deploy/?q=

I have gone passed the point of the tutorial and am now setting up my own work on the site.
Settings.py file has been set to gitignore so I stop getting merge conflicts
I wanted to see if I could build a website, so this is my project.
Grateful to Django Girls for all the help getting this thing going.

Plans (unordered list):
  Add my whispering wall content
  Add a pygame project
  Learn Javascript and add something with that
  Personalize and style the site as I go
  Keep adding pieces of everything I can do and learn to showcase my programming abilities
  Add links to all my online work so I can use this as a resume
