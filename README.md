# My Website -- NelliesNoodles
# now my first website with apps
First commit and blog page is initial setup taught in:

Django Girls @ https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/deploy/?q=

I have gone passed the point of the tutorial and am now setting up my own work on the site.
Settings.py file has been set to gitignore so I stop getting merge conflicts
I wanted to see if I could build a website, so this is my project.
Grateful to Django Girls for all the help getting this thing going.

### Plans / TO-DO ###
* Add more whispering wall content
* Add a pygame project
* Learn Javascript -- add more responsive design
* Personalize and style the site as I go
* Keep adding pieces of everything I can do and learn to showcase my programming abilities
* Add links to all my online work so I can use this as a resume
