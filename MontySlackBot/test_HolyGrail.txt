ARTHUR:  Old woman!
 DENNIS:  Man!
 ARTHUR:  Man, sorry.  What knight lives in that castle over there?
 DENNIS:  I'm thirty seven.
 ARTHUR:  What?
 DENNIS:  I'm thirty seven -- I'm not old!
 ARTHUR:  Well, I can't just call you `Man'.
 DENNIS:  Well, you could say `Dennis'.
 ARTHUR:  Well, I didn't know you were called `Dennis.'
 DENNIS:  Well, you didn't bother to find out, did you?
 ARTHUR:  I did say sorry about the `old woman,' but from the behind you looked--
 DENNIS:  What I object to is you automatically treat me like an inferior!
 ARTHUR:  Well, I AM king...
 DENNIS:  Oh king, eh, very nice.  An' how'd you get that, eh?  By  exploitin' the workers -- by 'angin' on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the economic an' social differences in our society! If there's ever going to be any progress--
 WOMAN:  Dennis, there's some lovely filth down here.  Oh -- howd'you do?
 ARTHUR:  How do you do, good lady.  I am Arthur, King of the Britons.  Who's castle is that?
 WOMAN:  King of the who?
 ARTHUR:  The Britons.
 WOMAN:  Who are the Britons?
 ARTHUR:  Well, we all are. we're all Britons and I am your king.
 WOMAN:  I didn't know we had a king.  I thought we were an
autonomous collective.
 DENNIS:  You're fooling yourself.  We're living in a dictatorship.  A self-perpetuating autocracy in which the working classes--
 WOMAN:  Oh there you go, bringing class into it again.
 DENNIS:  That's what it's all about if only people would--
 ARTHUR:  Please, please good people.  I am in haste.  Who lives in that castle?
 WOMAN:  No one live there.
 ARTHUR:  Then who is your lord?
 WOMAN:  We don't have a lord.
 ARTHUR:  What?
 DENNIS:  I told you.  We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune.  We take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the
week.
 ARTHUR:  Yes.
 DENNIS:  But all the decision of that officer have to be ratified at a special biweekly meeting.
 ARTHUR:  Yes, I see.
 DENNIS:  By a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs,--
 ARTHUR:  Be quiet!
 DENNIS:  --but by a two-thirds majority in the case of more--
 ARTHUR:  Be quiet!  I order you to be quiet!
 WOMAN:  Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
 ARTHUR:  I am your king!
 WOMAN:  Well, I didn't vote for you.
 ARTHUR:  You don't vote for kings.
 WOMAN:  Well, 'ow did you become king then?
 ARTHUR:  The Lady of the Lake, [angels sing] her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water signifying by Divine Providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. [singing stops] That is why I am your king!
 DENNIS:  Listen -- strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
 ARTHUR:  Be quiet!
 DENNIS:  Well you can't expect to wield supreme executive power  just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
 ARTHUR:  Shut up!
 DENNIS:  I mean, if I went around sayin' I was an empereror just  because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me they'd  put me away!
 ARTHUR:  Shut up!  Will you shut up!
 DENNIS:  Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system.
 ARTHUR:  Shut up!
 DENNIS:  Oh!  Come and see the violence inherent in the system!  

  HELP! HELP! I'm being repressed!
 ARTHUR:  Bloody peasant!
 DENNIS:  Oh, what a give away.  Did you here that, did you here that, eh?  That's what I'm on about -- did you see him repressing me, you saw it didn't you?

     [battle sounds]
     [Black Knight defeats a worthless-piece-of-shit-knight]
 ARTHUR:  You fight with the strength of many men, Sir knight.    
          I am Arthur, King of the Britons.    
          I seek the finest and the bravest knights in the land to join me in my Court of Camelot.    
          You have proved yourself worthy; will you join me?    
          You make me sad.  So be it.  Come, Patsy.
 BLACK KNIGHT:  None shall pass.
 ARTHUR:  What?
 BLACK KNIGHT:  None shall pass.
 ARTHUR:  I have no quarrel with you, good Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.
 BLACK KNIGHT:  Then you shall die.
 ARTHUR:  I command you as King of the Britons to stand aside!
 BLACK KNIGHT:  I move for no man.
 ARTHUR:  So be it!
     [hah]
     [parry thrust]
     [ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHT's left arm off]
 ARTHUR:  Now stand aside, worthy adversary.
 BLACK KNIGHT:  'Tis but a scratch.
 ARTHUR:  A scratch?  Your arm's off!
 BLACK KNIGHT:  No, it isn't.
 ARTHUR:  Well, what's that then?
 BLACK KNIGHT:  I've had worse.
 ARTHUR:  You liar!
 BLACK KNIGHT:  Come on you pansy!
     [hah]     [parry thrust]
     [ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHT's right arm off]
 ARTHUR:  Victory is mine!
     [kneeling]
     We thank thee Lord, that in thy merc-
     [Black Knight kicks Arthur in the head while he is praying]
 BLACK KNIGHT:  Come on then.
 ARTHUR:  What?
 BLACK KNIGHT:  Have at you!
 ARTHUR:  You are indeed brave, Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
 BLACK KNIGHT:  Oh, had enough, eh?
 ARTHUR:  Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.
 BLACK KNIGHT:  Yes I have.
 ARTHUR:  Look!
 BLACK KNIGHT:  Just a flesh wound.
     [Headbutts Arthur in the chest]
 ARTHUR:  Look, stop that.
 BLACK KNIGHT:  Chicken!  Chicken!
 ARTHUR:  Look, I'll have your leg.  Right!
     [whop]
 BLACK KNIGHT:  Right, I'll do you for that!
 ARTHUR:  You'll what?
 BLACK KNIGHT:  Come 'ere!
 ARTHUR:  What are you going to do, bleed on me?
 BLACK KNIGHT:  I'm invincible!
 ARTHUR:  You're a loony.
 BLACK KNIGHT:  The Black Knight always triumphs!     Have at you! 

Come on then.
     [whop]
     [ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHT's other leg off]
 BLACK KNIGHT:  All right; we'll call it a draw.
 ARTHUR:  Come, Patsy.
 BLACK KNIGHT:  Oh, oh, I see, running away then.  You yellow    

bastards!  Come back here and take what's coming to you. I'll bite
your legs off!
  Scene 5
 CROWD:  A witch!  A witch!  A witch!  We've got a witch!  A witch!
 VILLAGER #1:  We have found a witch, might we burn her?
 CROWD:  Burn her!  Burn!
 BEDEMIR:  How do you know she is a witch?
 VILLAGER #2:  She looks like one.
 BEDEMIR:  Bring her forward.
 WITCH:  I'm not a witch.  I'm not a witch.
 BEDEMIR:  But you are dressed as one.
 WITCH:  They dressed me up like this.
 CROWD:  No, we didn't -- no.
 WITCH:  And this isn't my nose, it's a false one.
 BEDEMIR:  Well?
 VILLAGER #1:  Well, we did do the nose.
 BEDEMIR:  The nose?
 VILLAGER #1:  And the hat -- but she is a witch!
 CROWD:  Burn her!  Witch!  Witch!  Burn her!
 BEDEMIR:  Did you dress her up like this?
 CROWD:  No, no... no ... yes.  Yes, yes, a bit, a bit.
 VILLAGER #1:  She has got a wart.
 BEDEMIR:  What makes you think she is a witch?
 VILLAGER #3:  Well, she turned me into a newt.
 BEDEMIR:  A newt?
 VILLAGER #3:  I got better.
 VILLAGER #2:  Burn her anyway!
 CROWD:  Burn!  Burn her!
 BEDEMIR:  Quiet, quiet.  Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
 CROWD:  Are there?  What are they?
 BEDEMIR:  Tell me, what do you do with witches?
 VILLAGER #2:  Burn!
 CROWD:  Burn, burn them up!
 BEDEMIR:  And what do you burn apart from witches?
 VILLAGER #1:  More witches!
 VILLAGER #2:  Wood!
 BEDEMIR:  So, why do witches burn?
     [pause]
 VILLAGER #3:  B--... 'cause they're made of wood...?
 BEDEMIR:  Good!
 CROWD:  Oh yeah, yeah...
 BEDEMIR:  So, how do we tell whether she is made of wood?
 VILLAGER #1:  Build a bridge out of her.
 BEDEMIR:  Aah, but can you not also build bridges out of stone?
 VILLAGER #2:  Oh, yeah.
 BEDEMIR:  Does wood sink in water?
 VILLAGER #1:  No, no.
 VILLAGER #2:  It floats!  It floats!
 VILLAGER #1:  Throw her into the pond!
 CROWD:  The pond!
 BEDEMIR:  What also floats in water?
 VILLAGER #1:  Bread!
 VILLAGER #2:  Apples!
 VILLAGER #3:  Very small rocks!
 VILLAGER #1:  Cider!
 VILLAGER #2:  Great gravy!
 VILLAGER #1:  Cherries!
 VILLAGER #2:  Mud!
 VILLAGER #3:  Churches -- churches!
 VILLAGER #2:  Lead -- lead!
 ARTHUR:  A duck.
 CROWD:  Oooh.
 BEDEMIR:  Exactly!  So, logically...,
 VILLAGER #1:  If... she.. weighs the same as a duck, she's made of wood.
 BEDEMIR:  And therefore--?
 VILLAGER #1:  A witch!
 CROWD:  A witch! 

 BEDEMIR:  We shall use my largest scales!
     [yelling]
 BEDEMIR:  Right, remove the supports!
     [whop]
     [creak]
 CROWD:  A witch!  A witch!
 WITCH:  It's a fair cop.
 CROWD:  Burn her!  Burn!
  [yelling]
 BEDEMIR:  Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
 ARTHUR:  I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
 BEDEMIR:  My liege!
 ARTHUR:  Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot,  and join us at the Round Table?
 BEDEMIR:  My liege!  I would be honored.
 ARTHUR:  What is your name?
 BEDEMIR:  Bedemir, my leige.
 ARTHUR:  Then I dub you Sir Bedemir, Knight of the Round Table.     
 NARRATOR:  The wise Sir Bedemir was the first to join King Arthur's knights, but other illustrious names were soon to follow: Sir Launcelot the Brave; Sir Galahad the Pure; and Sir Robin the Not-quite-so-brave-as-Sir-Launcelot who had nearly fought the Dragon of Agnor, who had nearly stood up to the vicious Chicken of Bristol and who had personally wet himself at the Battle of Badon Hill; and the aptly named Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film.  Together they formed a band whose names and deeds were to be retold throughout the centuries, the Knights of the Round Table.  Scene 6
  BEDEMIR:  And that, my liege, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
 ARTHUR:  This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedemir.  Explain again how sheeps' bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
 BEDEMIR:  Oh, certainly, sir.
 LAUNCELOT:  Look, my liege!
 ARTHUR:  Camelot!
 GALAHAD:  Camelot!
 LAUNCELOT:  Camelot!
 PATSY:  It's only a model.
 ARTHUR:  Shhh!  Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home.  Let us ride... to Camelot.
      [singing]
     We're knights of the round table
     We dance when e'er we're able
     We do routines and parlour scenes
     With footwork impecc-Able.
     We dine well here in Camelot
     We eat ham and jam and spam a lot
      [dancing]
     We're knights of the Round Table
     Our shows are for-mid-able
     Oh many times we're given rhymes
     That are quite unsing-able
     We not so fat in Camelot
     We sing from the diaphragm a lot
      [tap-dancing]
     Oh we're tough and able
     Quite indefatigable
     Between our quests we [something]
     And impersonate Clark Gable
     It's a bit too loud in Camelot
     I have to push the pram a lot.

 ARTHUR:  Well, on second thought, let's not go to Camelot -- it is a silly place.    Right.
   
 GOD:  Arthur!  Arthur, King of the Britons!  Oh, don't grovel!  If there's one thing I can't stand, it's people groveling.
 ARTHUR:  Sorry--
 GOD:  And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's "sorry this" and "forgive me that" and "I'm not worthy".  What are you doing now!?
 ARTHUR:  I'm averting my eyes, oh Lord.
 GOD:  Well, don't.  It's like those miserable Psalms -- they're so depressing.  Now knock it off!
 ARTHUR:  Yes, Lord.
 GOD:  Right!  Arthur, King of the Britons -- you're Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times.
 ARTHUR:  Good idea, oh Lord!
 GOD:  'Course it's a good idea!  Behold!  Arthur, this is the Holy Grail.  Look well, Arthur, for it is your sacred task to seek this Grail. That is your purpose, Arthur -- the Quest for the Holy Grail.
 ARTHUR:  A blessing!
 LAUNCELOT:  A blessing from the Lord!
 GALAHAD:  God be praised!
      [clop clop]
 ARTHUR:  Halt!  Hallo!  Hallo!
 GUARD:  'Allo!  Who is zis?
 ARTHUR:  It is King Arthur, and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Who's castle is this?
 GUARD:  This is the castle of my master, Guido Wommer!
 ARTHUR:  Go and tell your master that we have been charged by God  with a sacred quest.  If he will give us food and shelter for the night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
 GUARD:  Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be verykeen... Uh, he's already got one, you see?
 ARTHUR:  What?
 GALAHAD:  He says they've already got one!
 ARTHUR:  Are you sure he's got one?
 GUARD:  Oh, yes, it's very nice-a  (I told him we already got one)
 ARTHUR:  Well, um, can we come up and have a look?
 GUARD:  Of course not!  You are English types-a!
 ARTHUR:  Well, what are you then?
 GUARD:  I'm French!  Why do think I have this outrageous accent,
you silly king!
 GALAHAD:  What are you doing in England?
 GUARD:  Mind your own business!
 ARTHUR:  If you will not show us the Grail, we shall take your castle by force!
